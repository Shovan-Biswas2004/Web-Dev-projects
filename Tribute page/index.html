        <li><strong>1933</strong> - Born as Mumtaz Jehan Begum Dehlavi in Delhi , was an Indian actress who worked in Hindi films. The country's highest-paid star in early 1950s, Madhubala appeared in over 60 films in a career spanning more than two decades. </li><br>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> -  Following an approval from the studio executives, Chunnilal signed Madhubala to a juvenile role in Bombay Talkies' production, Basant (1942), at a salary of ₹150.</li><br>
        <li><strong>1960</strong> - Journalist Dinesh Raheja has described K. Asif's Mughal-e-Azam (1960) as the "crowning glory" of Madhubala's career. Co-starring Dilip Kumar and Prithviraj Kapoor, the film revolves around a 16th-century court dancer, Anarkali (Madhubala), and her affair with the Mughal prince Salim (Kumar).</li><br>
        <li><strong>1964–69</strong> - Following a sabbatical of two years, Madhubala completed Sharabi in 1964; the film would go on to become her final release in her lifetime.</li><br>
        <li><strong>1951</strong> - Madhubala's first relationship was with her Badal co-star Prem Nath, in early 1951. They dated for six months before differences figured out due to religion—Nath was a Hindu. Although the relationship fizzled out soon, Nath nevertheless remained close to Madhubala and her father Ataullah Khan for the rest of their lives.</li><br>
        <li><strong>1958</strong> - On the sets of Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958), Madhubala rekindled a friendship with Kishore Kumar, who was a childhood acquaintance. They went on to date for two years and had a court marriage on 16 October 1960</li><br>
        <li><strong>1969</strong> - Madhubala spent her final years bedridden and lost a lot of weight. Her particular fascination was Urdu poetry and she regularly watched her films (particularly Mughal-e-Azam) on a home projector. She grew very reclusive, meeting only Geeta Dutt and Waheeda Rehman from the film industry in those days.She had to undergo exchange transfusion almost every week. Her body began producing excess blood that would spill out of her nose and mouth; Vakil had to thus extract the blood to prevent complications, and an oxygen cylinder had to kept by her side as she often suffered from hypoxia. After the Chalaak incident, Madhubala turned her attention to film direction and began preparing for her directorial debut, titled Farz aur Ishq, in February 1969.</li><br>
        <li><strong>1969</strong> - By early 1969, Madhubala's health was in serious and major decline: she had just contracted jaundice and on urinalysis was diagnosed as having hematuria. Madhubala suffered a heart attack in the midnight of 22 February. After struggling for few hours amongst her family members and Kishore, she died at 9:30 a.m. of 23 February, only nine days after turning 36.[192] Madhubala was buried at Juhu Muslim Cemetery in Santacruz, Bombay along with her personal diary. Her tomb was built with marbles and inscriptions include aayats from Quran and verse dedications.</li><br>
